## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to work with tables and put borders on individual rows

```html
<table>
  <tr class="row">
    <td></td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="row">
    <td></td>
  </tr>

  <tr class="row">
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Also I now learnt how to use the border-collapse to make sure every individual row has it's own borders

```css
table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

.row {
  border-bottom: solid lightgray 3px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to really work on changing fonts I dont know how to do that all from the whole process of importing
new fonts to implementing them in css with different styles
